The present invention relates to a method and system for analyzing the influencing factors of economic losses due to accidents. In the method section, multiple stochastic parameter models are first established based on the GB2 model. Then, the LOOIC values are used for effect comparison to select an appropriate stochastic parameter model for analysis, allowing for the determination of the positive or negative impacts of various explanatory variables on economic losses from accidents. Finally, based on sensitivity analysis, the degree of influence of the explanatory variables on economic losses due to accidents is explored. Through the proposed solution of the present invention, an objective, comprehensive, and precise analysis method for identifying the influencing factors of economic losses due to accidents is provided, with a broad application range, better characterizing the impact of related factors on the economic losses caused by accidents.
