The invention relates to a method of calibrating the OD matrix of residential travel using cell phone signaling big data and dynamic traffic assignment, the main steps of which include: constructing an urban road simulation network model, calibrating the simulation parameters of each road segment in the constructed urban road network using microwave and bayonet data, obtaining the real traffic flow in the actual road network using microwave detectors, obtaining the initial OD by using cell phone signaling data The traffic flow of the matrix, through the dynamic traffic allocation method, the initial traffic flow is dynamically adjusted to make it close to the real traffic flow in the road network, calculate the error between the simulated estimated traffic flow and the real traffic flow, if it meets the threshold value, the calibration is finished, otherwise, the simulation-based dynamic allocation continues until the calibration is finished. The invention uses cell phone signaling data to calibrate the dynamic OD matrix of residents' trips, which has the characteristics of stable and objective data source, large sample size, wide coverage, high data accuracy, and strong dynamics.
