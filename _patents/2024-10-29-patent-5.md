The present invention provides an assessment method for the attention allocation mechanism of pedestrians crossing the street based on virtual reality simulation, including the following steps:
Step S1: Obtain eye-tracking data during the simulated pedestrian crossing process, as well as trajectory coordinate data for pedestrians and each moving vehicle.
Step S2: Convert each moving vehicle into an axis-aligned bounding box and simulate the generation of pedestrian gaze rays based on eye-tracking data. Additionally, determine the maximum and minimum vertex values of the axis-aligned bounding box based on the trajectory coordinate data.
Step S3: Based on the gaze rays, obtain the maximum and minimum parameters for the gaze rays entering the axis-aligned bounding box using the maximum and minimum vertex values.
Step S4: Match the maximum and minimum parameters with intersection conditions to obtain gaze duration results, characterizing the attention allocation of pedestrians while crossing the street.
The beneficial effect of the present invention is that it can address the defects of traditional methods, such as uncontrolled experimental environments, incomplete data acquisition, safety issues, and low accuracy.
