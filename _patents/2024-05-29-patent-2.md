A method, device, electronic equipment, and storage medium for road network simulation have been disclosed, which pertain to the field of traffic. The server processes the traffic information of the road network to be simulated according to the set image segmentation features, thereby dividing the road network to be simulated to obtain multiple sub-networks, and instructs multiple simulation units to simulate the sub-networks in parallel. After the division of the road network, the expected simulation duration included in different sub-networks is similar, making the time required for multiple simulation units to simulate different sub-networks tend to be consistent. This solves the problem of large differences in simulation duration among different sub-networks, which affects the efficiency of road network simulation.
