This invention relates to the fields of urban traffic management, supervision, and traffic simulation, and provides a human-vehicle interaction simulation method, system, and application based on the improved social force model. The method includes the following steps: S1 constructing the improved social force model; S2 constructing a decision model, which is used to determine the behavior patterns when pedestrians and vehicles encounter each other; S3 providing initial basic data for pedestrians and vehicles, and using the improved social force model and decision model to simulate the interaction between human and vehicle movement. This invention can be applied to scenarios where vehicles and pedestrians mix at intersections without traffic lights, such as cross intersections and multi-directional intersections. The invention significantly improves the realism of the model in complex traffic environments, allowing for more accurate simulation of pedestrian behavior decisions in real-world scenarios, especially when there is a potential conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. Through modular design and the introduction of transfer learning, the model can quickly adapt to dynamically changing environments.
