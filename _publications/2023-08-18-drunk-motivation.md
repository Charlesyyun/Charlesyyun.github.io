Intoxicated pedestrians are vulnerable while crossing roads owing to impaired cognitive and decision-making abilities. Therefore, understanding the motivations of pedestrian behaviors under the influence of alcohol is crucial for improving pedestrian safety. Due to the heterogeneity of individuals' characteristics and complex cognitive decision-making processes, the motivations driving pedestrian behaviors remain unobservable and challenging to estimate. In this study, a virtual reality based pedestrian crossing experiment was conducted, and pedestrians' mid-block crossing behavior was modeled as a Markov decision process. An inverse reinforcement learning approach was adopted to reveal the safety and efficiency motivations underlying pedestrian behaviors impacted by alcohol. The results justified the merits of our approach to capturing the shift in pedestrian motivations between safety and efficiency in response to alcohol and analyzing the effect of external factors on these motivations. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers to understand pedestrian behavior patterns and implement effective measures to enhance pedestrian safety.
