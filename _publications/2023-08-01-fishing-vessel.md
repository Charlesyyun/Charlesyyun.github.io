This research aims to identify and analyze the significant risk factors that contribute to accidents involving fishing vessels, a crucial step towards enhancing safety and promoting sustainable practices in the fishing industry. Using a Bayesian network model, which is data-driven and incorporates feature selection using the Random Forest method, we explore these key factors and their interconnected relationships. An analysis of past academic studies and accident investigation reports from the Fisheries Mutual Insurance Association (FMIA) revealed 17 such factors. We then used the Random Forest model to rank these factors in terms of their importance, selecting 11 critical ones to build the Bayesian model. The Bayesian Network (BN) model, also data-driven, is further utilized to delve deeper into the central factors influencing fishing vessel accidents. Upon validation, the study results show that the incorporation of the Random Forest feature selection method enhances the simplicity, reliability, and precision of the BN model. This finding is backed by thorough performance evaluation and scenario analysis.
