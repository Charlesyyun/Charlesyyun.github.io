The road traffic system is a complex, dynamic system with numerous interrelated variables. To study and reflect the interactions among these internal variables and between internal and external variables, mathematical models can be constructed under certain assumptions, forming the basis for traffic simulation. The accuracy of the traffic model in describing the system, as well as the correctness of its structure, plays a critical role in the reliability of the simulation results. Additionally, the repeatability and sustainability of simulation techniques provide valuable feedback for model construction and impose higher demands on traffic system modeling.
This course covers the fundamental theories, methods, and practices of traffic system modeling and simulation. It is divided into three parts across eight chapters. The first part focuses on traffic system modeling, including the concept of traffic systems, relevant definitions, commonly used models, and basic methods of traffic system modeling. The second part introduces traffic system simulation, including the basics of traffic simulation and traffic simulation models. The third part presents practical case studies, providing specific examples from macro, meso, and micro perspectives.
