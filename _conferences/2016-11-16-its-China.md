With the continuous development of urbanization in China, the rapid growth of traffic demand puts great pressure on infrastructure and traffic organization and management. It is important to study and evaluate the dynamic impact of traffic strategies on road networks before and after their implementation to support the decision making of traffic management departments. In this paper, a dynamic traffic assignment model based on the mesoscopic traffic simulation tool DTALite is developed for the main urban road network in Hangzhou. Firstly, the static OD is generated based on the cell phone signaling data; secondly, the supply and demand parameters are calibrated based on the collected microwave and chokepoint data, including the basic road segment calibration, road resistance function calibration, and dynamic OD calibration based on the dynamic traffic assignment results; lastly, the quantitative impact of the large area-occupied operation area on the overall road network operation status before Hangzhou G20 summit is evaluated through empirical research. The results showed that the average travel time of the road network in the main urban area increased by 56.60% and the average travel speed of the road network decreased by 36.11%. The simulation model of dynamic traffic assignment driven by big data developed in this paper has wide application prospects in the evaluation and optimization of comprehensive traffic control strategies.
